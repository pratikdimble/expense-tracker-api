An expense tracker is a tool or application that helps individuals or businesses monitor and manage their income and expenses. It allows users to track where their money is being spent, identify spending habits, and ultimately improve budgeting and saving practices. Expense trackers can be manual, such as written logs or spreadsheets, or digital, with dedicated apps or software providing more advanced features.

Key Features of an Expense Tracker:
Income Tracking: Record all sources of income, such as salary, freelance earnings, investments, etc.
Expense Categorization: Categorize expenses (e.g., groceries, transportation, entertainment, utilities, etc.) for better analysis.
Budgeting: Set up monthly or yearly budgets to compare actual spending against planned limits.
